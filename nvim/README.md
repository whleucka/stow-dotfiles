# Neovim Config

*A minimalist, plugin-free Neovim setup for people who think `init.lua` is a lifestyle choice.*

## Welcome.
This isn't for everyone.
This is for the keyboard monks. The no-mouse prophets. The config freaks.
If you're still reading this, you're probably one of us.

## Philosophy
Do less. Think more.
Edit fast. Exit faster.
Become the plugin.

## Recommended Setup
- Terminal: Kitty or Alacritty
- Fonts: Whatever monospace font makes you feel something
- Shell: bash, zsh, fish, or pure spite

## License
MIT. Fork it, trash it, rewrite it. I donâ€™t care.

Good luck out there.
